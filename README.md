# DataLearnBballSalaryProjection
In this project, I built two machine learning models--a neural network using Pytorch, and a linear regression model--to train on data of NBA players' salaries and game stats. 
The purpose of the model is learn how to predict the quantity of an NBA player's salary based on their stats such as points, rebounds, assists, etc.
This project was a collaboration with another student in the club dataLearn at UCLA.
